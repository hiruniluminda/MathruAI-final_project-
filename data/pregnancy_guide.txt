# Pregnancy Guide Knowledge Base

## First Trimester (Weeks 1-12)
During the first trimester, many women experience morning sickness, fatigue, and breast tenderness. It's important to take prenatal vitamins containing folic acid. Avoid alcohol, smoking, and raw foods. Regular prenatal checkups are essential.

## Second Trimester (Weeks 13-27)
The second trimester is often called the "golden period" of pregnancy. Morning sickness usually subsides, and energy levels increase. The baby's movements become noticeable around week 18-20. Continue taking prenatal vitamins and maintain a healthy diet.

## Third Trimester (Weeks 28-40)
The third trimester brings rapid baby growth and weight gain. Common symptoms include back pain, heartburn, and difficulty sleeping. Prepare for labor by attending childbirth classes. Monitor baby movements daily.

## Nutrition During Pregnancy
Eat a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins. Avoid high-mercury fish, raw eggs, and unpasteurized dairy. Stay hydrated by drinking plenty of water. Limit caffeine intake.

## Exercise During Pregnancy
Regular moderate exercise is beneficial during pregnancy. Safe activities include walking, swimming, and prenatal yoga. Avoid contact sports and activities with fall risks. Always consult your healthcare provider before starting any exercise routine.

## Warning Signs
Contact your healthcare provider immediately if you experience severe headaches, vision changes, severe abdominal pain, heavy bleeding, or reduced fetal movements after week 28.
